# Glock-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview

This is my second project in my 2025 professional portfolio, previously I built a payroll dashboard in Tableau.

The aim of this project was to learn about web scraping, and explore and analyze data in a subject that is completely foreign to me

The project only uses python libraries, such as selenium for webscraping, pandas and matplotlib for data analysis and visualization

There may be a follow up project in the future that visualizes this data in a dashboard or a report (probably a report)

## Notes

In my last project, I still didn't know about version control or documentation with Git, this was the first project I included documentation and version control
The commits are quite descriptive, since it was a solo project I didn't mind having wordy commits.
