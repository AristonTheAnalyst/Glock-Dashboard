    "This data was scraped responsibly with Selenium from the official Glock website (https://eu.glock.com) on April 24, 2025. Only public data was accessed.\n",
    "I chose to explore and analyse the active product range of Glock pistols for this exploaratory data analysis (EDA) project as I thought it would be interesting to apply data science methods to a domain I knew little about. Exploring unfamiliar industries is always a good way to sharpen up ones ability to ask questions and stay curious.  Special thanks to my friend Brandon for teaching me the basics of firearms to help kickstart this project.\n",

    "Gaston Glock was an Austrian engineer and businessman who founded Glock in 1963. Initially, the company specialized in manufacturing curtain rods and military equipment like knives and grenade casings. When Glock turned to firearms development in the early 1980s, he had no prior pistolsmithing experience — but his background in industrial fabrication and materials engineering became a key advantage. Instead of relying on traditional, handcrafted methods, Glock emphasized the use of modern machinery, automation, and polymer technology. This approach reduced production costs, minimized human error, and created consistent, high-quality parts with tight tolerances. His first firearm, the Glock 17, was a lightweight, durable, and highly reliable semi-automatic pistol. It quickly won the Austrian Army’s contract in 1982 and soon became a global phenomenon. Today, Glock pistols are the most widely used handpistols by law enforcement, military, and civilians around the world, valued for their rugged simplicity and unmatched reliability.\n",

    "Glock pistols have built a reputation for being rugged, reliable, and highly functional. When pistol owners think of a Glock, they often associate it with simplicity, toughness and practicality- a \"no-frills\" tool built to perform in any scenario. However, For many people unfamiliar with firearms, Glocks have gained a reputation as small, lightweight \"plastic pistols\" with limited power and range. This perception stems largely from popular media, where Glocks are often portrayed as token weapons or standard-issue pistols that lack the stopping power of larger firearms. Movies and video games like Counter-Strike have reinforced this image by positioning Glocks as token or starter weapons. In this project, we will explore and analyze the range of Glock firearms and debunk facts from fiction through statistical methods and learn a thing or two about Glock pistols."

    "Despite being portrayed as weak in pop culture, 9mm is highly effective in real-world use due to its low recoil, high magazine capacity, and strong stopping power with modern ammunition. These traits make it ideal for military, law enforcement, and self-defense, which explains why the majority of Glock pistols in the dataset are chambered in 9mm. Glock’s original Glock 17 helped popularize the caliber, and with NATO standardization and advances in bullet design, most agencies now favor 9mm over heavier rounds.\n",

It became widely used in the '90s but has since declined as 9mm ammo improved over time. The chart reflects this shift—Glock produces far fewer .40-caliber models today, aligning with a broader industry move back to 9mm for its balance for performance and efficiency.\n",

Despite industry skepticism over its polymer frame, the G17 passed NATO durability tests without a single malfunction. Lesser known is that early Glock 17s lacked a manual safety, sparking controversy and contributing to its “plastic gun” myth. Over time, the G17 evolved into the most diversified Glock, with training, threaded-barrel, and MOS (Modular Optic System) variants—making it both an innovator and a platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Glock 19, introduced in 1988, was Glock’s second pistol and the company’s first compact model. Building upon the success of the full-size Glock 17, the G19 offered a shorter barrel and grip, making it more suitable for concealed carry while maintaining a respectable 15-round magazine capacity. This balance of size and firepower quickly made it a favorite among law enforcement, military personnel, and civilian shooters alike. Its versatility allowed it to serve effectively as both a duty weapon and a concealed carry firearm just like its predecessor."

    "The Glock 17 and Beretta 92FS are both full-size 9mm service pistols that serve as flagship models in their respective lineups. Despite both being chambered in 9mm with similar magazine capacities, they differ notably in design and market positioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Glock 17 like many other glocks, features a polymer frame, contributing to its lighter weight of approximately 630 grams when unloaded. In contrast, the Beretta 92FS, with its aluminum alloy frame, weighs about 945 grams unloaded . Nearly a 50% difference in product weight, which highlights the benefits of Glock products for extended carry, appealing to both law enforcement and civilian users seeking a balance between portability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both pistols hold significant positions in their manufacturers' offerings. The Glock 17, originally introduced in the 1980s, set the standard for Glock's line of reliable, easy-to-maintain firearms. The Beretta 92FS, adopted by the U.S. military as the M9 in 1985, has been a symbol of durability and precision in Beretta's lineup.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of market share, Glock has achieved substantial coverage, particularly in U.S. law enforcement. A research survey sent across the US law enforcement agencies in 2018 showcases that <a href=\"https://www.officer.com/tactical/firearms/press-release/21001909/glock-inc-a-growing-number-of-us-law-enforcement-agencies-make-the-switch-to-glock-pistols?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"> Glock pistols were the preferred choice for 65% of U.S. law enforcement agencies. </a> This widespread adoption underscores Glock's emphasis on lightweight design, reliability, and cost-effectiveness, distinguishing it from competitors like Beretta.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while both the Glock 17 and Beretta 92FS are esteemed service pistols, the Glock 17, like many of the other product offerings, utilizes its lighter weight and smaller size to appeal strongly to its customerbase, especially among law enforcement agencies seeking efficiency and ease of use."
